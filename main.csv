We aimed to elucidate the relationship between the CNS representation of interoceptive processing - the late part of the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) - and the self-reported interoceptive abilities and tendencies as assessed with the scales of Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) questionnaire. The HEP amplitudes at 400-600ms and MAIA scores from 30 healthy participants were subjected to the cluster-based permutation tests on the t-values of Pearson correlations. HEP amplitudes were positively associated with individual scores on the Not-Worrying scale of MAIA at Cz in the time window from 400ms to 545ms after the R peak. No other MAIA scales were related to the late HEP amplitudes  suggesting that scales and HEPs measure different aspects that are not directly interrelated.

Sometimes  we become aware of our body signals and use them in planning and strategic thinking. Here  we show behavioral and neural dissociations between learning to follow one's own heartbeat and metacognitive awareness of one's performance  in a heartbeat-tapping task performed before and after auditory feedback. The electroencephalography amplitude of the heartbeat-evoked potential in interoceptive learners  that is  participants whose accuracy of tapping to their heartbeat improved after auditory feedback  was higher compared with non-learners. However  an increase in gamma phase synchrony (30-45 Hz) after the heartbeat auditory feedback was present only in those participants showing agreement between objective interoceptive performance and metacognitive awareness. Source localization in a group of participants and direct cortical recordings in a single patient identified a network hub for interoceptive learning in the insular cortex. In summary  interoceptive learning may be mediated by the right insular response to the heartbeat  whereas metacognitive awareness of learning may be mediated by widespread cortical synchronization patterns. ,heartbeat-evoked[All Fields] AND potential[All Fields],25899708,,,MP,HH,0,,1,0,,1,1,,MP,HH,,,Training interoception using auditory feedback for hbtapping.

Cardiac information to the brain relies on two pathways  terminating in the insular cortex (IC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)  along with the somatosensory cortex (S1-S2). Interoception relying on these neuroanatomical pathways has been shown to modulate social cognition. We report the case study of C.S.  a patient with an 'external heart' (an extracorporeal left-univentricular cardiac assist device  LVAD). The patient was assessed with neural/behavioral measures of cardiac interoception complemented by neuropsychological and social cognition measures. The patient's performance on the interoception task (heartbeat detection) seemed to be guided by signals from the artificial LVAD  which provides a somatosensory beat rather than by his endogenous heart. Cortical activity (HEP  heartbeat-evoked potential) was found decreased in comparison with normal volunteers  particularly during interoceptive states. The patient accurately performed several cognitive tasks  except for interoception-related social cognition domains (empathy  theory of mind and decision making). This evidence suggests an imbalance in the patient's cardiac interoceptive pathways that enhances sensation driven by the artificial pump over that from the cardiac vagal-IC/ACC pathway. A patient with two hearts  one endogenous and one artificial  presents a unique opportunity to explore models of interoception and heart-brain interaction. ,heartbeat-evoked[All Fields] AND potential[All Fields],23887813,"Given paucity of info reported and 5 participants, I suggest we exlcude",,MP,HH,0,,1,0,,1,1,,MP,HH,,,Case vs controls during rest vs counting,intero.attention,statistics for rest vs count in controls,,5,0,5,yes,twohearts,casecontrol,no,,5 controls vs 1 patient with heart machine,,biosemi, not reported,128,avgreference,2048,yes,,,other,2,lead2,not reported,,,0.3,40,none,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,subract EKG from EEG,rpeak,-200,800,not reported,not reported,report number of epochs but not how many taken out; analyse both with and without cardiac correction,,"2 (tapping hb, tapping tone)",1,422.4,,,point by point,0-800,all,not reported,not reported,previous studies,8,none,1,no,"channel numbers reported only for positions, impossible to find in 10-20 according to any biosemi nomenclature.

This study investigated whether the neural processing of internal body state (interoception) is associated with empathy  the understanding of the affective states of others. We used the 'heartbeat-evoked potential' (HEP)  a surface electroencephalography (EEG) pattern  as a neural index of interoceptive processing. The HEP is contingent on the most prominent peak (R-wave) of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and is thought to reflect cortical processing of cardiac afferent input. Twenty-one healthy adults performed empathy and control tasks while EEG and ECG were recorded  where they made judgments based on either the affective or physical aspects of images of human eyes. HEP  ECG and heart rate in each task block were calculated and compared. Results showed that cardiac activity was not significantly different between tasks. In contrast  HEP showed a significant task difference  exhibited as an increased negativity during the empathy task over frontocentral sites at a latency of approximately 250-430 ms. Furthermore  a self-reported measure of empathy was associated with mean HEP amplitude during the period of task-related differentiation.

In fact  most standardized interoceptive tasks require directing attention to internal signals. However  most studies in the field have failed to compare attentional modulations between internally- and externally-driven processes  thus probing blind to the specificity of the former. Here we address this issue through a multidimensional approach combining behavioral measures  analyses of event-related potentials and functional connectivity via high-density electroencephalography  and intracranial recordings. In Study 1  50 healthy volunteers performed a heartbeat detection task as we recorded modulations of the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) in three conditions: exteroception  basal interoception (also termed interoceptive accuracy)  and post-feedback interoception (sometimes called interoceptive learning). In Study 2  to evaluate whether key interoceptive areas (posterior insula  inferior frontal gyrus  amygdala  and somatosensory cortex) were differentially modulated by externally- and internally-driven processes  we analyzed human intracranial recordings with depth electrodes in these regions. This unique technique provides a very fine grained spatio-temporal resolution compared to other techniques  such as EEG or fMRI. We found that both interoceptive conditions in Study 1 yielded greater HEP amplitudes than the exteroceptive one. In addition  connectivity analysis showed that post-feedback interoception  relative to basal interoception  involved enhanced long-distance connections linking frontal and posterior regions. Moreover  results from Study 2 showed a differentiation between oscillations during basal interoception (broadband: 35-110 Hz) and exteroception (1-35 Hz) in the insula  the amygdala  the somatosensory cortex  and the inferior frontal gyrus.

"Gentsch, Sel, Marshall, Schütz-Bosbach",Gentsch2018,2018,Affective interoceptive inference: Evidence from heart-beat evoked brain potentials.,Human brain mapping,The perception of internal bodily signals (interoception) is central to many theories of emotion and embodied cognition. According to recent theoretical views  the sensory processing of visceral signals such as one's own heartbeat is determined by top-down predictions about the expected interoceptive state of the body (interoceptive inference). In this EEG study we examined neural responses to heartbeats following expected and unexpected emotional stimuli. We used a modified stimulus repetition task in which pairs of facial expressions were presented with repeating or alternating emotional content  and we manipulated the emotional valence and the likelihood of stimulus repetition. We found that affective predictions of external socially relevant information modulated the heartbeat-evoked potential  a marker of cardiac interoception. Crucially  the HEP changes highly relied on the expected emotional content of the facial expression. Thus  expected negative faces led to a decreased HEP amplitude  whereas such an effect was not observed after an expected neutral face. These results suggest that valence-specific affective predictions  and their uniquely associated predicted bodily sensory state  can reduce or amplify cardiac interoceptive responses. In addition  the affective repetition effects were dependent on repetition probability  highlighting the influence of top-down exteroceptive predictions on interoception. Our results are in line with recent models of interoception supporting the idea that predicted bodily states influence sensory processing of salient external information.,heartbeat-evoked[All Fields] AND potential[All Fields],30159945,,,MP,HH,0,,1,0,,1,1,,MP,HH,,,Effect of repetition of emotional faces on HEP; correlation with hbcounting,"intero.correlation, intero.arousal",statistics for correlation between hbcounting and HEP; statistics for repeat vs non-repeat,,19,2,17,no,,within,no,,,,biosemi,eeglab,63,avgreference,128,yes,,,biosemi,2,left clavicle/pectoral muscle,512,,,1,40,no,yes,no,yes,no,,,yes,ica + analyses with shifted,rpeak,-100,600,-100;0,mean subtraction,,,3 (repetition neutral vs repetition negative; neutral vs negative),,,,,mean amplitude,100-600,previous studies,5,AFZ-FPZ-AF4-AF3-AF8-AF7-F1-FZ-F2-FC1-FCZ-CZ-FC2-FT8-F6-FC5-F5-F7-F3-FT7-PO7-PO3-P3-P1-O1-POZ-OZ-Iz-O2-P2-PO4-PO8-CP5-CP3-P9-P7-P5-P3-CP6-CP4-P8-P6-P4,data driven,43,none,,no,"used ""morphological"" analysis to choose channels in main analyses",,permutations t-test,no,1,,,clusterbased,none,,"In this line, we hypothesize that the expectation of a negative facial expression would lead to a greater repetition suppression effect on the HEP component that would be characteristically different to the repetition effects when expecting a neutral expression.",full,cohend,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,correlation with the repetition effect but not the actual HEP.

"Gray, Taggart, Sutton, Groves, Holdright, Bradbury, Brull, Critchley",Gray2007,2007,A cortical potential reflecting cardiac function.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Emotional trauma and psychological stress can precipitate cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death through arrhythmogenic effects of efferent sympathetic drive. Patients with preexisting heart disease are particularly at risk. Moreover  generation of proarrhythmic activity patterns within cerebral autonomic centers may be amplified by afferent feedback from a dysfunctional myocardium. An electrocortical potential reflecting afferent cardiac information has been described  reflecting individual differences in interoceptive sensitivity (awareness of one's own heartbeats). To inform our understanding of mechanisms underlying arrhythmogenesis  we extended this approach  identifying electrocortical potentials corresponding to the cortical expression of afferent information about the integrity of myocardial function during stress. We measured changes in cardiac response simultaneously with electroencephalography in patients with established ventricular dysfunction. Experimentally induced mental stress enhanced cardiovascular indices of sympathetic activity (systolic blood pressure  heart rate  ventricular ejection fraction  and skin conductance) across all patients. However  the functional response of the myocardium varied; some patients increased  whereas others decreased  cardiac output during stress. Across patients  heartbeat-evoked potential amplitude at left temporal and lateral frontal electrode locations correlated with stress-induced changes in cardiac output  consistent with an afferent cortical representation of myocardial function during stress. Moreover  the amplitude of the heartbeat-evoked potential in the left temporal region reflected the proarrhythmic status of the heart (inhomogeneity of left ventricular repolarization). These observations delineate a cortical representation of cardiac function predictive of proarrhythmic abnormalities in cardiac repolarization.

The predominant theories of increased vagal efferents and baroreflex gain are insufficient in explaining the frequent observations that HRV Biofeedback impacts changes in constructs beyond ANS mediation  such as emotion regulation  attentional control  and self-regulatory reserve. It has been suspected that vagal afferent functioning may be the underlying mechanism  but little research has explored this. Previously  researchers measured cortical evoked potentials contingent to the heart  or an indication of vagal afferent functioning (Schandry et al.  1986). Twenty-five participants were randomly stratified to HRV Biofeedback or EMG Biofeedback for four sessions. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that the HRV group exhibited statistically significantly increased baseline Heartbeat Event-Related Potentials (updated term for 'evoked potential') while the relaxation control group did not.

Cognitive theories propose that this is one aspect of self-focus  which is driven by concerns that features of the self  such as anxiety symptoms  will elicit evaluation from others. We investigated the relationship of social anxiety to the cortical processing of heartbeats as reflected in the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) during false feedback of accelerated heart rate. Thirty-eight participants with high social anxiety (HSA; n = 19) and non-elevated social anxiety (NSA; n = 19) completed a cognitive task during which false feedback of accelerated heart rate was randomly provided on 50% of trials. HEP amplitude was larger in HSAs  but not NSAs  during false heartbeat acceleration cues compared to standard cues. HEP amplitude also was larger in HSAs compared to NSAs during acceleration cues. HEP amplitude during acceleration cues  but not standard cues correlated with social anxiety. Within the first second after the R-peak  social anxiety correlated with voltage at Fz from 223 to 305 ms.

"Lechinger, Heib, Gruber, Schabus, Klimesch",Lechinger2016,2016,Heartbeat-related EEG amplitude and phase modulations from wakefulness to deep sleep: Interactions with sleep spindles and slow oscillations.,Psychophysiology,Based on physiological models of neurovisceral integration  different studies have shown how cognitive processes modulate heart rate and how the heartbeat  on the other hand  modulates brain activity. We tried to further determine interactions between cardiac and electrical brain activity by means of EEG. We investigated how the heartbeat modulates EEG in 23 healthy controls from wakefulness to deep sleep and showed that frontocentral heartbeat evoked EEG amplitude and phase locking (as measured by intertrial phase locking)  at about 300-400 ms after the R peak  decreased with increasing sleep depth with a renewed increase during REM sleep  which underpins the assumption that the heartbeat evoked positivity constitutes an active frontocortical response to the heartbeat. Additionally  we found that individual heart rate was correlated with the frequency of the EEG's spectral peak (i.e.  alpha peak frequency during wakefulness). This correlation was strongest during wakefulness and declined linearly with increasing sleep depth. Furthermore  we show that the QRS complex modulates spindle phase possibly related to the correspondence between the frequency of the QRS complex and the spindle frequency of about 12-15 Hz. Finally  during deep sleep stages  a loose temporal coupling between heartbeats and slow oscillation (0.8 Hz) could be observed. These findings indicate that cardiac activity such as heart rate or individual heartbeats can modulate or be modulated by ongoing oscillatory brain activity. ,heartbeat-evoked[All Fields] AND potential[All Fields],26268858,,,MP,HH,0,,1,0,,1,1,,MP,HH,,,HEP across different stages of sleep,,NO INTEROCEPTION EXCLUDE?,,23,1,22,no,,within,no,,,,neuroscan,brainvision,22,avgmastoids,250,yes,,,not reported,not reported,not reported,250,,,0.1,70,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,control analysis,rpeak,-200,600,not reported,not reported,,,"6 (wake, rem, stage 1-5)",1,not reported,report max 1000 epoch per level but not number,,peak amplitude,200-450,visual inspection,1,"F7, F3, FZ, F4, F8; C3, CZ, C4",none,8,"frontal, central",2,no,,,anova,yes,2,24,3,none,fdr,yes,"First of all, we investigated the heartbeat evoked positivity at about 300–400 ms, and hypothesized that, if this frontocortical response relates to cardiac awareness, then its amplitude should decrease with sleep depth.",full,partialeta,yes,numcells calculated using average of num locations x sleep stages,,no,,,,,,,,,,,correlate with sleep oscillations,,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no

This potential appears as a positive waveform ranging from 250 to 600 ms after the onset of ventricular contraction. Only limited information exists as to what extent the HEP is sensitive to a dysfunction in cardio-afferent pathways. Thus  the HEP was studied in patients with autonomic diabetic neuropathy.METHODS: Twenty-five patients and a healthy control group of equal size participated. The HEP was obtained as the average over 1200 EEG sweeps (18 channels) sampled contingent upon the onset of ventricular contraction. A heartbeat attention task and a distraction task were employed. Patients answered a questionnaire pertaining to the frequency of subjective symptoms related to diabetic neuropathy.RESULTS: The HEP amplitude at frontal  central and temporal locations was significantly diminished in patients in the latency range of 280-330 ms. A significant correlation was found between the questionnaire score of subjective autonomic symptoms and the reduction in the HEP.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the HEP is sensitive to a comparably moderate abnormality in nerve function.

"Luft, Bhattacharya",Luft2016,2016,Aroused with heart: Modulation of heartbeat evoked potential by arousal induction and its oscillatory correlates.,Scientific reports,Recent studies showed that the visceral information is constantly processed by the brain  thereby potentially influencing cognition. One index of such process is the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP)  an ERP component related to the cortical processing of the heartbeat. The HEP is sensitive to a number of factors such as motivation  attention  pain  which are associated with higher levels of arousal. However  the role of arousal and its associated brain oscillations on the HEP has not been characterized  yet it could underlie the previous findings. Here we analysed the effects of high- (HA) and low-arousal (LA) induction on the HEP. Further  we investigated the brain oscillations and their role in the HEP in response to HA and LA inductions. As compared to LA  HA was associated with a higher HEP and lower alpha oscillations. Interestingly  individual differences in the HEP modulation by arousal induction were correlated with alpha oscillations. In particular  participants with higher alpha power during the arousal inductions showed a larger HEP in response to HA compared to LA. In summary  we demonstrated that arousal induction affects the cortical processing of heartbeats; and that the alpha oscillations may modulate this effect. ,heartbeat-evoked[All Fields] AND potential[All Fields],26503014,,,MP,JM,0,,1,0,,1,1,,MP,HH,,,High vs Low arousal on HEP,intero.arousal,low vs high arousal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Utilizing heartbeat evoked potentials (HEPs)  we sought to determine whether heart rate variability (HRV) was related to the strength of the connection between the heart and brain. We also hypothesized that differing emotion states would result in differing amplitudes of HEPs. Participants were induced into emotional states with an autobiographical script of their happiest and saddest memory. HEPs were also recorded during diaphragmatic breathing at six breaths per minute. The evoked potentials during the emotional conditions  especially negative emotion were most attenuated. We believe that the signal from the heart to the brain may be filtered by central limbic structures affecting the level of the signal at the cortex. It also appears that HRV affects the strength of HEPs  especially during resonant breathing. Significant neurocardiac gender differences were also present across all conditions. The results of this study support the theory and speculation of many authors who believe vagal afferents play a role in brain function.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",23824262,,,MP,JM,0,,1,0,,1,1,,MP,JM,,,Positive/negative emotional state vs baseline,"intero.arousal, ecg.correlation",negative and positive vs baseline; HEP vs ecg indices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies which have examined interoception in adolescents with the use of HEPs are not known to the authors so far. This study investigated the function of the HEP as a marker of interoception in adolescents. EEG and ECG were recorded in 46 adolescents during a resting condition and during a heartbeat detection task. Participants were asked for confidence in their interoceptive accuracy during heartbeat perception. HEPs appeared during both conditions  showing maximal activity over frontocentral electrodes in the heartbeat condition  and highest activity over occipital locations in the resting condition. Interoceptive accuracy (IAc) was positively associated with the HEP at frontocentral locations only for the heartbeat condition. Interoceptive sensibility was not associated with the HEP. No significant association between IAc and interoceptive sensibility was revealed. Our results highlight the relevance of the HEP as a neural marker of interoception in adolescents.

Here  we explore repetition suppression of intero- and exteroceptive neural markers to test whether the perception and predictability of exteroceptive stimulus material affects their expression. Participants completed a repetition suppression paradigm in which angry or neutral facial expressions repeated or alternated. Participants received either an implicit (experiment 1) or explicit (experiment 2) cue enabling the formation of expectations regarding the upcoming facial expression. We measured the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) indexing cardiac processing and visual evoked potentials (VEP) in response to viewing the second (repeated or alternated) face. Repeating angry facial expressions produced repetition suppression of both HEP and VEP amplitude while repeating neutral expressions led to repetition enhancement of HEP amplitude. This effect was magnified when participants were explicitly aware of predictive cues. Furthermore  repetition suppression of HEP amplitude correlated with neural attenuation of VEP activity. Results highlight repetition effects for interoceptive as well as exteroceptive neural markers and support top-down  expectation-based accounts of the phenomenon.

Research demonstrates that interoceptive markers can be modulated via exteroceptive stimuli and suggests that the emotional content of this information may produce distinct interoceptive outcomes. Here  we explored the impact of differently valenced exteroceptive information on the processing of interoceptive signals. Participants completed a repetition-suppression paradigm viewing repeating or alternating faces. In experiment 1  faces wore either angry or pained expressions to explore the interoceptive response to different types of negative stimuli in the observer. In experiment 2  expressions were happy or sad to compare interoceptive processing of positive and negative information. We measured the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) as a respective marker of intero- and exteroceptive processing. We observed increased HEP amplitude to repeated sad and pained faces coupled with reduced HEP and VEP amplitude to repeated angry faces. No effects were observed for positive faces. However  we found a significant correlation between suppression of the HEP and VEP to repeating angry faces.

A system-wide process?,"Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)","OBJECTIVES: This study aims to contribute to a scientific understanding of intuition a process by which information normally outside the range of conscious awareness is perceived by the body's psychophysiological systems. The first objective presented in two empirical reports (Part 1 and Part 2) was to replicate and extend the results of previous experiments demonstrating that the body can respond to an emotionally arousing stimulus seconds before it is actually experienced. The second objective to be presented in a forthcoming publication (Part 3) is to develop a theory that explains how the body receives and processes information involved in intuitive perception.DESIGN:The study used a counterbalanced crossover design in which 30 calm and 15 emotionally arousing pictures were presented to 26 participants under two experimental conditions: a baseline condition of ""normal"" psychophysiologic function and a condition of physiological coherence. Primary measures included: skin conductance; the electroencephalogram (EEG) from which cortical event-related potentials (ERP) and heartbeatevoked potentials (HBEP) were derived; and the electrocardiogram (ECG) from which cardiac decelerations/ accelerations were derived. These measures were used to investigate where and when in the brain and body intuitive information is processed.RESULTS:The main findings presented here are: (1) surprisingly both the heart and brain appear to receive and respond to intuitive information; (2) even more surprisingly there is compelling evidence that the heart appears to receive intuitive information before the brain; (3) there were significant differences in prestimulus ERPs for calm versus emotional stimuli; (4) the frontal cortex temporal occipital and parietal areas appear to be involved in the processing of prestimulus information; (5) there were significant differences in prestimulus calm/emotional HBEPs primarily in the coherent mode; (6) there were significant gender differences in the processing of prestimulus information. Especially noteworthy is the apparent interaction between the HBEPs and ERPs in the females which suggests that the heart modulates the ERP and that females are more attuned to intuitive informatin from the heart.CONCLUSIONS:Overall our data suggest that the heart and brain together are involved in receiving processing and decoding intuitive information. On the basis of these results and those of other research it would thus appear that intuitive perception is a system-wide process in which both the heart and brain (and possibly other bodily systems) play a critical role. To account for the study's results Part 3 will develop a theory based on holographic principles explaining how intuitive perception accesses a field of energy into which information about ""future"" events is spectrally enfolded.",15165413,15165413,Added manually by MP,,MP,HH,0,,1,0,,1,1,,MP,JM,,,Emotional vs neutral pictures; normal vs physiological coherence,intero.arousal,emotional vs neutral pictures;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus  disturbed interoception might contribute to the core feature of emotional dysregulation in borderline personality disorder (BPD)  as increased levels of depersonalization  body image disturbances  and reduced sensitivity to physical pain suggest poor body awareness in BPD.OBJECTIVE: To determine neural correlates of disturbed body awareness in BPD and its associations with emotional dysregulation and to explore improvements in body awareness with BPD symptom remission.DESIGN  SETTING  AND PARTICIPANTS: Case-control study performed at Heidelberg University Hospital  Heidelberg  Germany. Heartbeat evoked potentials (HEPs)  an indicator of the cortical representation of afferent signals from the cardiovascular system  were investigated in 34 medication-free patients with BPD  31 healthy volunteers  and 17 medication-free patients with BPD in remission. The HEPs were assessed using 5-minute resting-state electroencephalograms and parallel electrocardiograms. Core BPD symptoms  history of childhood traumatization  and psychiatric disorders were assessed by means of self-reports and structured interviews. To measure neural correlates of disturbed body awareness  high-resolution T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected and analyzed using voxel-based morphometry and region-of-interest-based approaches. The study was performed between 2012 and 2014  and data analysis was performed in 2014.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean HEP amplitudes in resting-state electroencephalograms and their correlation with self-reported emotional dysregulation  as well as with gray matter volume.RESULTS: Patients with BPD had significantly reduced mean HEP amplitudes compared with healthy volunteers (F1 61 = 11.32  P = .001)  whereas the mean HEP amplitudes of patients with BDP in remission lie somewhere in between these 2 groups of participants (P &gt; .05). The HEP amplitudes were negatively correlated with emotional dysregulation (R = -0.30  P = .01) and positively associated with gray matter volume in the left anterior insula (R = 0.53  P &lt; .05) and the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (R = 0.47  P &lt; .05)  2 structures that have been identified as core regions for interoception.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results indicate state-dependent deficits in the cortical processing of bodily signals in patients with BPD  which appear to be associated with core features of BPD.

Thirty undergraduate students (15 females) watched a video in both 2D and 3D for an hour. Because visual fatigue is related to cognitive load  the HEP was used as an indicator of communication between the heart and the brain and therefore of cognitive function; responses were compared after 2D and 3D viewing. At the standard EEG sites F3 and F4  the alpha activity of the first and second HEP components was significantly increased after 3D video viewing relative to 2D. This increase likely indicates that sensory input from 3D video requires heavy computation by the brain  stimulating heart activity. The conclusion is that the first and second HEP components are significant parameters that can quantitatively evaluate 3D visual fatigue. Further work is needed to uncover the cause of 3D visual fatigue. ,heartbeat-evoked[All Fields] AND potential[All Fields],25911524,,,MP,JM,0,,1,0,,1,1,,MP,JM,,,watching sync vs async touch,"intero.arousal, intero.correlation",sync vs async touch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pollatos, Herbert, Mai, Kammer",Pollatos2017,2017,Changes in interoceptive processes following brain stimulation.,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences",The processing and perception of individual internal bodily signals (interoception) has been differentiated to comprise different levels and processes involved. The so-called heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) offers an additional possibility to examine automatic processing of cardiac signals. Knowledge on neural structures potentially supporting different facets of interoception is still sparse. One way to get insights into neuroanatomical function is to manipulate the activity of different brain structures. In this study  we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and a continuous theta-burst protocol to inhibit specific central locations of the interoceptive network including the right anterior insula and the right somatosensory cortices and assessed effects on interoceptive facets and the HEP in 18 male participants. Main results were that inhibiting anterior insula resulted in a significant decline in cardiac and respiratory interoceptive accuracy (IAc) and in a consistent decrease in perception confidence. Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over somatosensory cortices reduced only cardiac IAc and affected perception confidence. Inhibiting right anterior insula and right somatosensory cortices increased interoceptive sensibility and reduced the HEP amplitude over frontocentral locations. Our findings strongly suggest that cTBS is an effective tool to investigate the neural network supporting interoceptive processes.This article is part of the themed issue 'Interoception beyond homeostasis: affect  cognition and mental health'.,heartbeat-evoked[All Fields] AND potential[All Fields],28080973,,,MP,JM,0,,1,0,,1,1,,MP,JM,,,good vs bad hbcounting,"intero.group, intero.correlation",good vs bad on task; corerlation with accuracy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pollatos, Kirsch, Schandry",Pollatos2005,2005,Brain structures involved in interoceptive awareness and cardioafferent signal processing: a dipole source localization study.,Human brain mapping,Afferent signals from the body play an important role for emotional and motivational aspects of behavior. Nevertheless  little is known about the cortical and subcortical structures involved in interoceptive processes. Recently  a functional MRI study demonstrated that insula  somatomotor  and cingulated cortices are activated when subjects focus attention on their heartbeats. Aside from the use of imaging data  cardiac awareness has frequently been studied by using the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP)  a brain wave that appears contingent on the heartbeat. The present study aimed at localizing sources of the HEP. Multichannel EEG was recorded in 44 subjects while they performed a heartbeat perception task. This task was used to quantify interoceptive awareness and to subdivide the subjects into good and poor heartbeat perceivers. Analyses showed highest HEP amplitudes over frontal and frontocentral electrode locations in the time range of later than 200 ms after R-wave onset. By means of a BESA dipole-source-analysis  four sources of the HEP were identified which were located in the anterior cingulate  the right insula  the prefrontal cortex  and the left secondary somatosensory cortex. Good heartbeat perceivers showed both significantly higher HEP amplitudes and higher dipole strength than poor heartbeat perceivers in all four cortical sources. We conclude that the identified structures are involved in the processing of cardiac signals  whereby anterior cingulate and right insula seem to serve as interoceptive centers for cardioception.,heartbeat-evoked[All Fields] AND potential[All Fields],15852466,,,MP,JM,0,,1,0,,1,1,,MP,JM,,,good vs bad hbcounting,intero.group,good vs bad on task,,44,0,22,no,,between,no,,,,neuroscan,brainvision,62,avgmastoid,1000,yes,,,neuroscan,2,clavicles,1000,,,0.01,100,none,no,80,no,yes,yes,8,yes,hjorth,rpeak,-200,824,not reported,not reported,,,hbcounting,0,not reported,,,mean amplitude,250-450,previous studies,1,FP1-AF3-F1-F9-AF7,all,,right anterior; left anterior; ,12,no,,,anova,yes,3,24,1,none,none,yes,"The present study aimed at

However  no specific neurocognitive impairment has yet been proposed as a core deficit underlying such symptoms. We aimed to determine whether MS patients present changes in interoception-that is  the monitoring of autonomic bodily information-a process that might be related to various bodily dysfunctions. We performed two studies in 34 relapsing-remitting  early-stage MS patients and 46 controls matched for gender  age  and education. In Study 1  we evaluated the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP)  a cortical signature of interoception  via a 128-channel EEG system during a heartbeat detection task including an exteroceptive and an interoceptive condition. Then  we obtained whole-brain MRI recordings. In Study 2  participants underwent fMRI recordings during two resting-state conditions: mind wandering and interoception. In Study 1  controls exhibited greater HEP modulation during the interoceptive condition than the exteroceptive one  but no systematic differences between conditions emerged in MS patients. Patients presented atrophy in the left insula  the posterior part of the right insula  and the right anterior cingulate cortex  with abnormal associations between neurophysiological and neuroanatomical patterns. In Study 2  controls showed higher functional connectivity and degree for the interoceptive state compared with mind wandering; however  this pattern was absent in patients  who nonetheless presented greater connectivity and degree than controls during mind wandering.

In the present paper  results from three studies  investigating the heartbeat-evoked potential are summarized.

Scalp potentials  averaged time-locked to the EKG-R-wave  were studied at Fz  Cz  and Pz under four conditions: resting (baseline)  heartbeat discrimination task  signal detection task  and heartbeat discrimination task after physical exercise. 22 subjects were assigned to the two groups &quot;good&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; perceivers  according to their performance in an initial heartbeat perception test. Event related potentials (ERPs) of &quot;good&quot; perceivers were more stable across conditions than those of &quot;poor&quot; perceivers. Peak latency within the range of 200 to 300 ms differed significantly between conditions. A principal component analysis performed on the ERP averages extracted five components. Subsequent ANOVAs across factor scores yielded significant main effects for the &quot;groups&quot; factor  experimental conditions and electrode sites. The strongest effects occurred over the frontal region in the latency range of 250-400 ms (following the EKG-R-wave).

Since heartbeat perception can be improved using appropriate training procedures  increased ability to perceive cardiac performance should also influence heartbeat-related potentials. In the present study  subjects in either of two groups had to press a button immediately after the occurrence of a heartbeat-feedback tone. Whereas the first group was given acoustical heartbeat-feedback throughout the entire training  the second group was provided with tone signals that became fainter during the course of the training phases. The better posttraining performance in heartbeat perception of the group receiving full-intensity feedback was also reflected in the evoked potentials. They differed markedly before and after training  especially between 250 to 400 ms (after the EKG-R-wave)  the biggest effect being at Fz and F7.

We investigated 16 healthy women on two separate days: when satiated (standardized food intake) and after an 18-h food deprivation period. On both days  heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) and cardiac and autonomic nervous system activation indices (heart rate  normalized low frequency heart rate variability [nLF HRV]) were assessed. The HEP is an EEG pattern that is considered an index of cortical representation of afferent cardiovascular signals. Average HEP activity (R wave +455-595 ms) was enhanced during food deprivation compared to normal food intake. Cardiac activation did not differ between nutritional conditions. Our results indicate that short-term food deprivation amplifies an electrophysiological correlate of the cortical representation of visceral-afferent signals originating from the cardiovascular system.

Here  we used a modified version of the Enfacement Illusion to investigate whether the integration of visual and cardiac information can alter self-face recognition (Experiment 1) and neural responses to heartbeats (Experiment 2). We projected a pulsing shade  that was synchronous or asynchronous with the participant's heartbeat  onto a picture depicting the participant's face morphed with the face of an unfamiliar other. Results revealed that synchronous (vs. asynchronous) cardio-visual stimulation led to increased self-identification with the other's face (Experiment 1)  while during stimulation  synchronicity modulated the amplitude of the Heartbeat Evoked Potential  an electrophysiological index of cortical interoceptive processing (Experiment 2). Importantly  the magnitude of the illusion-related effects was dependent on  and increased linearly  with the participants' Interoceptive Accuracy.

Clinical studies into this domain have focused on patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders  showing that damage to relevant brain mechanisms can variously alter interoceptive functions. However  the association between peripheral cardiac-system alterations and neurocognitive markers of interoception remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap  we examined multidimensional neural markers of interoception in patients with early stage of hypertensive disease (HTD) and healthy controls. Strategically  we recruited only HTD patients without cognitive impairment (as shown by neuropsychological tests)  brain atrophy (as assessed with voxel-based morphometry)  or white matter abnormalities (as evidenced by diffusion tensor imaging analysis). Interoceptive domains were assessed through (a) a behavioral heartbeat detection task; (b) measures of the heart-evoked potential (HEP)  an electrophysiological cortical signature of attention to cardiac signals; and (c) neuroimaging recordings (MRI and fMRI) to evaluate anatomical and functional connectivity properties of key interoceptive regions (namely  the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex). Relative to controls  patients exhibited poorer interoceptive performance and reduced HEP modulations  alongside an abnormal association between interoceptive performance and both the volume and functional connectivity of the above regions. Such results suggest that peripheral cardiac-system impairments can be associated with abnormal behavioral and neurocognitive signatures of interoception. More generally  our findings indicate that interoceptive processes entail bidirectional influences between the cardiovascular and the central nervous systems.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",29271093,,,JM,HH,0,,1,0,,1,1,,HH,JM,,,hypertensive vs control; hbd vs extero contorl,"intero.attention, intero.group",hbd vs extero; hypertensive vs controls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this is well established for the patients' relationship with external stimuli in the environment  no study has explored their monitoring of internal body signals  a process known to be affected in anxiety-related syndromes. Here  we explored this issue through a cardiac interoception task that measures sensing of heartbeats. Our aim was to explore key behavioral and electrophysiological aspects of internal-cue monitoring in OCD  while examining their potential distinctiveness in this condition.METHOD: We administered a heartbeat detection (HBD) task (with related interoceptive confidence and awareness measures) to three matched groups (OCD patients  panic disorder patients  healthy controls) and recorded ongoing modulations of two task-relevant electrophysiological markers: the heart evoked potential (HEP) and the motor potential (MP).RESULTS: Behaviorally  OCD patients outperformed controls and panic patients in the HBD task. Moreover  they exhibited greater amplitude modulation of both the HEP and the MP during cardiac interoception. However  they evinced poorer confidence and awareness of their interoceptive skills.CONCLUSIONS: Convergent behavioral and electrophysiological data showed that overactive monitoring in OCD extends to the sensing of internal bodily signals. Moreover  this pattern discriminated OCD from panic patients  suggesting a condition-distinctive alteration. Our results highlight the potential of exploring interoceptive processes in the OCD spectrum to better characterize the population's cognitive profile.

We previously reported reduced HEPs in children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)  indicative of attenuated cardiac information processing. The objective of this study was to investigate the link between HEP and respiration.METHODS: From the overnight polysomnograms of 40 healthy children and 40 children with SDB  we measured HEPs during epochs of stage 2  slow-wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep free of abnormal respiratory events. HEPs were analysed with respect to respiratory phase.RESULTS: We observed a marked association between respiratory phase and HEP in children with SDB during REM sleep  but not in normal children. In children with SDB  HEP waveforms were attenuated during expiration compared to inspiration. Following adenotonsillectomy  expiratory HEP peak amplitude increased in the SDB children and was no longer different from those of normal children.CONCLUSIONS: The expiratory phase of respiration is primarily associated with attenuated cardiac information processing in children with SDB  establishing a pathophysiological link between breathing and HEP attenuation.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",25912598,,,MP,HH,0,,1,1,children only,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recorded EEG while participants performed a speeded Go/No-Go task in which they signaled error commission. Visibility of the effector was manipulated  while IA was measured with a heartbeat perception task. The late Pe was larger for aware than unaware errors. The ERN was also found to be modulated by error awareness  but only when the hand was visible  suggesting that its sensitivity to error awareness depends on the availability of visual sensory feedback. Only when the response hand was visible  the late Pe amplitude to aware errors correlated with IA  suggesting that sensory feedback and IA synergistically contribute to the emergence of error awareness. These findings underscore the idea that several sources of information accumulate in time following action execution in order to enable errors to break through and reach awareness. ,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",26738634,,,MP,HH,0,,1,1,don't measure HEP just ERN,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate this  we measured brain activity during the recently described 'cardio-visual full body illusion' which combines interoceptive and exteroceptive signals  by providing participants with visual exteroceptive information about their heartbeat in the form of a periodically illuminated silhouette outlining a video image of the participant's body and flashing in synchrony with their heartbeat. We found  as also reported previously  that synchronous cardio-visual signals increased self-identification with the virtual body. Here we further investigated whether experimental changes in self-consciousness during this illusion are accompanied by activity changes in somatosensory cortex by recording somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). We show that a late somatosensory evoked potential component (P45) reflects the illusory self-identification with a virtual body.

To investigate if cortical processing of intrinsic information in children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is different from healthy children and  if so  whether it resolves with treatment  we used heartbeat as a source of interoceptive event-related brain potentials.OBJECTIVES: To investigate heartbeat evoked potentials (HEP) during sleep in healthy children and in children with SDB before and after treatment and to explore if there are any associations between HEP and daytime behavioral deficits in children with SDB.METHODS: Heartbeat-aligned EEG was assessed for presence of HEP within stage 2  slow-wave sleep  and REM sleep in 40 children with primarily mild to moderate SDB before and after adenotonsillectomy and in 40 matched control subjects at similar time points.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In both groups  nonrandom HEP were present in all sleep stages analyzed; however  amplitude of HEP were significantly lower in children with SDB during non-REM sleep (stage 2: P = 0.03; slow-wave sleep: P = 0.001). This between-group difference was not significant post adenotonsillectomy. Significant negative associations between HEP and daytime behavioral scores were observed at baseline.CONCLUSIONS: Children with SDB displayed reduced HEP amplitude during sleep  which might be indicative of changes in afferent sensory inputs to the brain and/or signify differences in sensory gating of cardiac-related information in the insular cortex.

"Kern, Aertsen, Schulze-Bonhage, Ball",,2014,"Heart cycle-related effects on event-related potentials, spectral power changes, and connectivity patterns in the human ECoG.",NeuroImage,The perception of one's own heartbeat is a fundamental interoceptive process that involves cortical and subcortical structures. Yet  the precise spatiotemporal neuronal activity patterns underlying the cortical information processing have remained largely elusive. Although the high temporal and spatial resolution of electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings is increasingly being exploited in functional neuroimaging  it has not been used to study heart cycle-related effects. Here  we addressed the capacity of ECoG to characterize neuronal signals within the cardiac cycle  as well as to disentangle them from heart cycle-related artifacts. Based on topographical distribution and latency  we identified a biphasic potential within the primary somatosensory cortex  which likely constitutes a heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) of neuronal origin. We also found two different types of artifacts: i) oscillatory potential changes with a frequency identical to the heart pulse rate  which probably represent pulsatility artifacts and ii) sharp potentials synchronized to the R-peak  corresponding to the onset of ventricular contraction and the cardiac field artifact (CFA) in EEG. Finally  we show that heart cycle-related effects induce pronounced phase-synchrony patterns in the ECoG and that this kind of correlation patterns  which may confound ECoG connectivity studies  can be reduced by a suitable correction algorithm. The present study is  to our knowledge  the first one to show a focally localized cortical HEP that could be clearly and consistently observed over subjects  suggesting a basic role of primary sensory cortex in processing of heart-related sensory inputs. We also conclude that taking into account and reducing heart cycle-related effects may be advantageous for many ECoG studies  and are of crucial importance  particularly for ECoG-based connectivity studies. Thus  in summary  although ECoG poses new challenges  it opens up new possibilities for the investigation of heartbeat-related viscerosensory processing in the human brain. ,heartbeat-evoked[All Fields] AND potential[All Fields],23684883,,,MP,HH,0,,1,1,ECOG only,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"McCraty, Atkinson, Bradley",,2004,Electrophysiological evidence of intuition: part 1. The surprising role of the heart.,"Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)",OBJECTIVES: This study aims to contribute to a scientific understanding of intuition  a process by which information normally outside the range of conscious awareness is perceived by the psychophysiological systems. The first objective  presented in two empirical papers (Part 1 and Part 2)  was to replicate and extend the results of previous experiments demonstrating that the body can respond to an emotionally arousing stimulus seconds before it is actually experienced. The second objective  to be presented in a third paper (Part 3)  is to develop a theory that explains how the body receives and processes information involved in intuitive perception.DESIGN: The study used a counterbalanced crossover design  in which 30 calm and 15 emotionally arousing pictures were presented to 26 participants under two experimental conditions: a baseline condition of normal psychophysiologic function and a condition of physiological coherence. Primary measures included: skin conductance; the electroencephalogram (EEG)  from which cortical event-related potentials and heartbeat-evoked potentials were derived; and the electrocardiogram (ECG)  from which cardiac decelerations/accelerations were derived. These measures were used to investigate where and when in the brain and body intuitive information is processed.RESULTS: The study's results are presented in two parts. The main findings in relation to the heart's role in intuitive perception presented here are: (1) surprisingly  the heart appears to receive and respond to intuitive information; (2) a significantly greater heart rate deceleration occurred prior to future emotional stimuli compared to calm stimuli; (3) there were significant gender differences in the processing of prestimulus information. Part 2 will present results indicating where in the brain intuitive information is processed and data showing that prestimulus information from the heart is communicated to the brain. It also presents evidence that females are more attuned to intuitive information from the heart.CONCLUSIONS: Overall  we have independently replicated and extended previous research documenting prestimulus responses. It appears that the heart is involved in the processing and decoding of intuitive information. Once the prestimulus information is received in the psychophysiologic systems  it appears to be processed in the same way as conventional sensory input. This study presents compelling evidence that the body's perceptual apparatus is continuously scanning the future. To account for the results presented in Parts 1 and 2  Part 3 will develop a theory based on holographic principles explaining how intuitive perception accesses a field of energy into which information about future events is spectrally enfolded.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",15025887,,,MP,JM,0,,1,1,HEP will be reported in part 2,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve detection of those signals in rapid object recognition tasks  we used the independent component analysis (ICA) to reduce &quot;global interference&quot; (heartbeat and contribution of superficial layers). We recorded optical signals from the left prefrontal cortex in 10 right-handed participants with a continuous-wave instrument (DYNOT  NIRx  Brooklyn  NY). Visual stimuli were pictures of urban  landscape and seashore scenes with various vehicles as targets (target-to-non-target ratio 1:6) presented at ISI=166 ms or 250 ms. Subjects mentally counted targets. Data were filtered at 2-30 Hz and artifactual components were identified visually (for heartbeat) and using the ICA weight matrix (for superficial layers). Optical signals were restored from the ICA components with artifactual components removed and then averaged over target and non-target epochs. After ICA processing  the event-related response was detected in 70%-100% of subjects. The refined signal showed a significant decrease from baseline within 200-300 ms after targets and a slight increase after non-targets. The temporal profile of the optical signal corresponded well to the profile of a &quot;differential ERP response&quot;  the difference between targets and non-targets which peaks at 200 ms in similar object detection tasks. These results demonstrate that the detection of fast optical responses with continuous-wave instruments can be improved through the ICA method capable to remove noise  global interference and the activity of superficial layers.

Several studies have shown behavioral effects of tES  but stimulation artifacts complicate the simultaneous investigation of neural activity with EEG or MEG. Here  we first show for EEG and MEG  that contrary to previous assumptions  artifacts do not simply reflect stimulation currents  but that heartbeat and respiration non-linearly modulate stimulation artifacts. These modulations occur irrespective of the stimulation frequency  i.e. during both transcranial alternating and direct current stimulations (tACS and tDCS). Second  we show that  although at first sight previously employed artifact rejection methods may seem to remove artifacts  data are still contaminated by non-linear stimulation artifacts. Because of their complex nature and dependence on the subjects' physiological state  these artifacts are prone to be mistaken as neural entrainment. In sum  our results uncover non-linear tES artifacts  show that current techniques fail to fully remove them  and pave the way for new artifact rejection methods. ,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",27039705,,,MP,JM,0,,1,1,no analyses of the heartbeat locked ERp,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that the perception of bodily states is positively related to the experienced intensity of feelings as well as to the activity of first-order and second-order brain structures involved in the processing of feelings. Using a heartbeat perception task  subjects were separated into groups with either high or poor interoceptive awareness. During emotional picture presentation we measured high-density EEG and used spatiotemporal current density reconstruction to identify regions involved in both interoceptive awareness and emotion processing. We observed a positive relation between interoceptive awareness and the experienced intensity of emotions. Furthermore  the P300 amplitudes to pleasant and unpleasant pictures were enhanced for subjects with high interoceptive awareness. The source reconstruction revealed that interoceptive awareness is related to an enhanced activation in both first-order structures (insula  somatosensory cortices) and second-order structures (anterior cingulate  prefrontal cortices).

Cognitive brain research,The perception of visceral signals plays a crucial role in many theories of emotions. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between interoceptive awareness and emotion-related brain activity. 44 participants (16 male  28 female) first underwent a heartbeat perception task and then were categorised either as good (n = 22) or poor heartbeat perceivers (n = 22). A total of 60 different pictures (pleasant  unpleasant  neutral) from the International Affective Picture System served as emotional stimuli. EEG (61 electrodes) and EOG were recorded during slide presentation. After each slide  the subjects had to rate emotional valence and arousal on a 9-point self-report scale. Good heartbeat perceivers scored the emotional slides significantly more arousing than poor heartbeat perceivers; no differences were found in the emotional valence ratings. The visually evoked potentials of good and poor heartbeat perceivers showed significant differences in the P300 and in the slow-wave latency ranges. Statistical analyses revealed significantly higher P300 mean amplitudes for good heartbeat perceivers (averaged across all 60 slides) than for poor heartbeat perceivers. In the slow-wave range  this effect was found for affective slides only. Heartbeat perception scores correlated significantly and positively with both the mean arousal rating as well as with the mean amplitudes in the P300 time window and the slow-wave window.

"Ronchi, Bernasconi, Pfeiffer, Bello-Ruiz, Kaliuzhna, Blanke",,2018,Interoceptive signals impact visual processing: Cardiac modulation of visual body perception.,NeuroImage,Multisensory perception research has largely focused on exteroceptive signals  but recent evidence has revealed the integration of interoceptive signals with exteroceptive information. Such research revealed that heartbeat signals affect sensory (e.g.  visual) processing: however  it is unknown how they impact the perception of body images. Here we linked our participants' heartbeat to visual stimuli and investigated the spatio-temporal brain dynamics of cardio-visual stimulation on the processing of human body images. We recorded visual evoked potentials with 64-channel electroencephalography while showing a body or a scrambled-body (control) that appeared at the frequency of the on-line recorded participants' heartbeat or not (not-synchronous  control). Extending earlier studies  we found a body-independent effect  with cardiac signals enhancing visual processing during two time periods (77-130 ms and 145-246 ms). Within the second (later) time-window we detected a second effect characterised by enhanced activity in parietal  temporo-occipital  inferior frontal  and right basal ganglia-insula regions  but only when non-scrambled body images were flashed synchronously with the heartbeat (208-224 ms). In conclusion  our results highlight the role of interoceptive information for the visual processing of human body pictures within a network integrating cardio-visual signals of relevance for perceptual and cognitive aspects of visual body processing.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",28669917,,,MP,JM,0,,1,1,don't measure HB locked ERPs just stimulus locked,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Waselius, Wikgren, Halkola, Penttonen, Nokia",,2018,Learning by heart: cardiac cycle reveals an effective time window for learning.,Journal of neurophysiology,Cardiac cycle phase is known to modulate processing of simple sensory information. This effect of the heartbeat on brain function is likely exerted via baroreceptors  the neurons sensitive for changes in blood pressure. From baroreceptors  the signal is conveyed all the way to the forebrain and the medial prefrontal cortex. In the two experiments reported  we examined whether learning  as a more complex form of cognition  can be modulated by the cardiac cycle phase. Human participants ( experiment 1) and rabbits ( experiment 2) were trained in trace eyeblink conditioning while neural activity was recorded. The conditioned stimulus was presented contingently with either the systolic or diastolic phase of the cycle. The tone used as the conditioned stimulus evoked amplified responses in both humans (electroencephalogram from &quot;vertex &quot; Cz) and rabbits (hippocampal CA1 local field potential) when its onset was timed at systole. In humans  the cardiac cycle phase did not affect learning  but rabbits trained at diastole learned significantly better than those trained at a random phase of the cardiac cycle. In summary  our results suggest that neural processing of external stimuli and also learning can be affected by targeting stimuli on the basis of cardiac cycle phase. These findings might be useful in applications aimed at maximizing or minimizing the effects of external stimulation. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY It has been shown that rapid changes in bodily states modulate neural processing of external stimulus in brain. In this study  we show that modulation of neural processing of external stimulus and learning about it depends on the phase of the cardiac cycle.

"Ando, Kuwasawa",,2005,"Neuronal and neurohormonal control of the heart in the stomatopod crustacean, Squilla oratoria.",The Journal of experimental biology,The heart of Squilla oratoria contains a cardiac ganglion that consists of 15 intrinsic neurons  supplied by a pair of inhibitory nerves and two pairs of excitatory nerves  arising from the central nervous system. These comprise the extrinsic cardiac innervation. The paired cardio-inhibitor (CI) nerves run out in the 10th pair of nerve roots emerging from the subesophageal ganglion (SEG). The cell bodies of the CI neurons are found in the hemisphere of the 1st segment of the SEG contralateral to the nerve roots in which the CI axons emerge. The two pairs of 1st and 2nd cardio-accelerator (CA1 and CA2) nerves run out in the 16th and 19th pairs of nerve roots of the SEG. The cell bodies of the CA1 and CA2 neurons are found in the hemispheres of the 3rd and 4th segments of the SEG ipsilateral to the nerve roots in which the CA1 and CA2 axons are found. The heartbeat was activated by application of glutamate  serotonin  dopamine  octopamine or acetylcholine  which were applied to the heart by perfusion into an organ bath. Joro-spider toxin (JSTX) blocked myocardial excitatory junctional potentials evoked by the cardiac ganglion. Neuronal cell bodies and processes in the heart were examined using immunocytochemical techniques. All 15 neurons of the cardiac ganglion showed glutamate-like immunoreactivity. Glutamate may be a neurotransmitter of the cardiac ganglion neurons. JSTX also blocked cardiac acceleration by activation of CA1 and CA2 axons. CA1 and CA2 axons showed glutamate-like immunoreactivity. It is likely that glutamate is a neurotransmitter for the cardio-acceleratory neurons. The heartbeat was inhibited by application of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA). Cardiac inhibition induced by activation of CI axons was blocked by picrotoxin. CI axons showed GABA-like immunoreactivity. These results may support the identification of GABA as an extrinsic inhibitory neurotransmitter.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",15579561,,,MP,HH,1,no HEP,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the relative contribution of these sources  we recorded physiological (respiration and cardiac) signals simultaneously with fMRI in human volunteers at rest with their eyes closed. State-of-the-art technology was used including high magnetic field (7 T)  a multichannel detector array and high-resolution (3 mm(3)) echo-planar imaging. We investigated the relative contribution of thermal noise and other sources of variance to the observed fMRI signal fluctuations both in the visual cortex and in the whole brain gray matter. The following sources of variance were evaluated separately: low-frequency drifts due to scanner instability  effects correlated with respiratory and cardiac cycles  effects due to variability in the respiratory flow rate and cardiac rate  and other sources  tentatively attributed to spontaneous neuronal activity. We found that low-frequency drifts are the most significant source of fMRI signal fluctuations (3.0% signal change in the visual cortex  TE=32 ms)  followed by spontaneous neuronal activity (2.9%)  thermal noise (2.1%)  effects due to variability in physiological rates (respiration 0.9%  heartbeat 0.9%)  and correlated with physiological cycles (0.6%). We suggest the selection and use of four lagged physiological noise regressors as an effective model to explain the variance related to fluctuations in the rates of respiration volume change and cardiac pulsation. Our results also indicate that  compared to the whole brain gray matter  the visual cortex has higher sensitivity to changes in both the rate of respiration and the spontaneous resting-state activity. Under the conditions of this study  spontaneous neuronal activity is one of the major contributors to the measured fMRI signal fluctuations  increasing almost twofold relative to earlier experiments under similar conditions at 3 T.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",19375260,,,MP,HH,1,no HEP,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Buckett, Peters, Benjamin",,1990,"Excitation and inhibition of the heart of the snail, Lymnaea, by non-FMRFamidergic motoneurons.",Journal of neurophysiology,1. The present paper extends the model of neuronal control of the Lymnaea heart by the use of intracellular recording techniques to identify further types of cardioactive neurons in the CNS that  like the previously described E heart excitor (Ehe) cells  influence the myogenic heartbeat. 2. Four new types of neuron that act on the heart are described. These are excitatory Hhe and She cells (H and S heart excitors) and the inhibitory Khi cell (K heart inhibitor). The fourth class  tonus pericardium excitor (Tpe)  modulates the heart by action on pericardial tissue. 3. Pharmacologic  electrophysiological  and anatomic evidence is presented that shows that these cells are motoneurons  innervating heart muscle fibers directly: blocking central chemical synapses failed to prevent the actions of the neurons on the heart; simultaneous intracellular recordings showed unitary EJPs in heart muscle after 1:1 and with constant delay from evoked neuronal action potentials; intracellular injection of the dye Lucifer yellow showed all cells had axonal branches entering the intestinal nerve (which innervates the heart). 4. The use of selective antagonists to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (cinanserin)  dopamine (ergonovine)  and acetylcholine (alpha-bungarotoxin) provided evidence that the actions of She and Hhe cells are mediated by 5-HT  whereas those of the Khi cell are mediated by acetylcholine. 5. A cyclically active network of three interneuronal inputs acting on the heart motoneurons is described. 6. One of these  input 3  is responsible for periodic excitation of the heart via its effects on the Hhe cells.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",2358884,,,MP,HH,1,no HEP,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Carmichael, Vulliemoz, Rodionov, Thornton, McEvoy, Lemieux",,2013,Simultaneous intracranial EEG-fMRI in humans: protocol considerations and data quality.,NeuroImage,We have recently performed simultaneous intracranial EEG and fMRI recordings (icEEG-fMRI) in patients with epilepsy. In this technical note  we examine limited thermometric data for potential electrode heating during our protocol and found that heating was ≤0.1 °C in-vitro at least 10 fold less than in-vivo limits. We quantify EEG quality  which can be degraded by MRI scanner-induced artefacts  and fMRI image (gradient echo echo-planar imaging: GE-EPI) signal quality around the electrodes  which can be degraded by electrode interactions with B1 (radiofrequency) and B0 (static) magnetic fields. We recorded EEG outside and within the MRI scanner with and without scanning. EEG quality was largely preserved during scanning and in particular heartbeat-related artefacts were small compared to epileptic events. To assess the GE-EPI signal reduction around the electrodes  we compared image signal intensity along paths into the brain normal to its surface originating from the individual platinum-iridium electrode contacts. GE-EPI images were obtained at 1.5 T with an echo time (TE) of 40 ms and repetition time (TR) of 3000 ms and a slice thickness of 2.5 mm. We found that GE-EPI signal intensity reduction was confined to a 10 mm radius and that it was reduced on average by less than 50% at 5mm from the electrode contacts. The GE-EPI image signal reduction also varied with electrode orientation relative to the MRI scanner axes; in particular  cortical grid contacts with a normal along the scanner's main magnetic field (B(0)) axis have higher artefact levels relative to those with a normal perpendicular to the z-axis. This suggests that the artefacts were predominantly susceptibility-related rather than due to B1 interactions. This information can be used to guide interpretation of results of icEEG-fMRI experiments proximal to the electrodes  and to optimise artefact reduction strategies.,"heartbeat-related[All Fields] AND (""brain""[MeSH Terms] OR ""brain""[All Fields]) AND potential[All Fields]",22652020,,,MP,HH,1,"No HEP, intracranial/fmri study",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chellappa, Lasauskaite, Cajochen",,2017,In a Heartbeat: Light and Cardiovascular Physiology.,Frontiers in neurology,Light impinging on the retina fulfils a dual function: it serves for vision and it is required for proper entrainment of the endogenous circadian timing system to the 24-h day  thus influencing behaviors that promote health and optimal quality of life but are independent of image formation. The circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei modulates the cardiovascular system with an intrinsic ability to anticipate morning solar time and with a circadian nature of adverse cardiovascular events. Here  we infer that light exposure might affect cardiovascular function and provide evidence from existing research. Findings show a time-of-day dependent increase in relative sympathetic tone associated with bright light in the morning but not in the evening hours. Furthermore  dynamic light in the early morning hours can reduce the deleterious sleep-to-wake evoked transition on cardiac modulation. On the contrary  effects of numerous light parameters  such as illuminance level and wavelength of monochromatic light  on cardiac function are mixed. Therefore  in future research studies  light modalities  such as timing  duration  and its wavelength composition  should be taken in to account when testing the potential of light as a non-invasive countermeasure for adverse cardiovascular events.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",29104560,,,MP,HH,1,"No HEP, review study?",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best studied example is the K+ channel activated by muscarinic agonists in the atrium  which plays a crucial role in regulating the heartbeat. To enable studies of the molecular mechanisms of activation  this channel  denoted KGA  was cloned from a rat atrium cDNA library by functional coupling to coexpressed serotonin type 1A receptors in Xenopus oocytes. KGA displays regions of sequence homology to other inwardly rectifying channels as well as unique regions that may govern G-protein interaction. The expressed KGA channel is activated by serotonin 1A  muscarinic m2  and delta-opioid receptors via G proteins. KGA is activated by guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate in excised patches  confirming activation by a membrane-delimited pathway  and displays a conductance equal to that of the endogenous channel in atrial cells. The hypothesis that similar channels play a role in neuronal inhibition is supported by the cloning of a nearly identical channel (KGB1) from a rat brain cDNA library.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",8234283,,,MP,HH,1,"No HEP, No EEG, molecular/ion channels",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"De Meo, Matusz, Knebel, Murray, Thompson, Clarke",,2017,What makes medical students better listeners?,Current biology : CB,Diagnosing heart conditions by auscultation is an important clinical skill commonly learnt by medical students. Clinical proficiency for this skill is in decline [1]  and new teaching methods are needed. Successful discrimination of heartbeat sounds is believed to benefit mainly from acoustical training [2]. From recent studies of auditory training [3 4] we hypothesized that semantic representations outside the auditory cortex contribute to diagnostic accuracy in cardiac auscultation. To test this hypothesis  we analysed auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) which were recorded from medical students while they diagnosed quadruplets of heartbeat cycles. The comparison of trials with correct (Hits) versus incorrect diagnosis (Misses) revealed a significant difference in brain activity at 280-310 ms after the onset of the second cycle within the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and the right prefrontal cortex. This timing and locus suggest that semantic rather than acoustic representations contribute critically to auscultation skills. Thus  teaching auscultation should emphasize the link between the heartbeat sound and its meaning. Beyond cardiac auscultation  this issue is of interest for all fields where subtle but complex perceptual differences identify items in a well-known semantic context.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",27404234,,,MP,HH,1,"No HEP, auditory evoked potentials",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet the mechanisms that coordinate this simultaneous opening during every heartbeat are unclear. Here  we demonstrate that CaV1.2 channels form clusters that undergo dynamic  reciprocal  allosteric interactions. This 'functional coupling' facilitates Ca(2+) influx by increasing activation of adjoined channels and occurs through C-terminal-to-C-terminal interactions. These interactions are initiated by binding of incoming Ca(2+) to calmodulin (CaM) and proceed through Ca(2+)/CaM binding to the CaV1.2 pre-IQ domain. Coupling fades as [Ca(2+)]i decreases  but persists longer than the current that evoked it  providing evidence for 'molecular memory'. Our findings suggest a model for CaV1.2 channel gating and Ca(2+)-influx amplification that unifies diverse observations about Ca(2+) signaling in the heart  and challenges the long-held view that voltage-gated channels open and close independently. ,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",25714924,,,MP,HH,1,"No HEP, No EEG, molecular/ion channels",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Grandy, Greenfield, Devonshire",,2013,An evaluation of in vivo voltage-sensitive dyes: pharmacological side effects and signal-to-noise ratios after effective removal of brain-pulsation artifacts.,Journal of neurophysiology,In the current study  we investigated pharmacological side effects and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of two commonly used voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs): the blue dye RH-1691 (1 mg/ml) and the red dye di-4-ANEPPS (0.1 mg/ml)  applied in vivo to the rat barrel cortex. Blue dyes are often favored over red dyes in in vivo studies due to their apparent superior SNR  partly because their fluorescence spectrum is farther away from the hemoglobin absorption spectrum  making them less prone to heartbeat-associated brain-pulsation artifacts (BPA). We implemented a previously reported template-based BPA removal algorithm and evaluated its applicability to di-4-ANEPPS before comparing characteristics of the two dyes. Somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) were also recorded. Whereas SEPs recorded before and after application of di-4-ANEPPS failed to exhibit demonstrable differences  RH-1691 caused a significant and prolonged increase in SEP amplitude for several hours. In contrast  neither dye influenced the spontaneous cortical activity as assessed by the spectral content of the EEG. Both dyes turned out to be strikingly similar with respect to changes in fractional fluorescence as a function of SEP response amplitude  as well as regarding shot noise characteristics after removal of the BPA. Thus there is strong evidence that the increased SNR for RH-1691 is a consequence of an artificially increased signal. When applying an appropriate BPA removal algorithm  di-4-ANEPPS has proven to be suitable for single-trial in vivo VSD imaging (VSDI) and produces no detectable neurophysiological changes in the system under investigation. Taken together  our data argue for a careful re-evaluation of pharmacological side effects of RH-1691 and support the applicability of di-4-ANEPPS for stable single-trial in vivo VSDI recordings.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",22972958,,,MP,HH,1,not relevant,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ivanov, Calabrese",,2003,Modulation of spike-mediated synaptic transmission by presynaptic background Ca2+ in leech heart interneurons.,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,At the core of the rhythmically active leech heartbeat central pattern generator are pairs of mutually inhibitory interneurons. Synaptic transmission between these interneurons consists of spike-mediated and graded components  both of which wax and wane on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Low-threshold Ca2+ currents gate the graded component. Ca imaging experiments indicate that these low-threshold currents are widespread in the neurons and that they contribute to neuron-wide changes in internal background Ca2+ concentration (Ivanov and Calabrese  2000). During normal rhythmic activity  background Ca2+ concentration oscillates  and thus graded synaptic transmission waxes and wanes as the neurons move from the depolarized to the inhibited phases of their activity. Here we show that in addition to gating graded transmitter release  the background Ca2+ concentration changes evoked by low-threshold Ca2+ currents modulate spike-mediated synaptic transmission. We develop stimulation paradigms to simulate the changes in baseline membrane potential that accompany rhythmic bursting. Using Ca imaging and electrophysiological measurements  we show that the strength of spike-mediated synaptic transmission follows the changes in background Ca2+ concentration that these baseline potential changes evoke and that it does not depend on previous spike activity. Moreover  we show using internal EGTA and photo-release of caged Ca2+ and caged Ca2+ chelator that changes in internal Ca2+ concentration modulate spike-mediated synaptic transmission. Thus activity-dependent changes in background Ca2+  which have been implicated in homeostatic regulation of intrinsic membrane currents and synaptic strength  may also regulate synaptic transmission in an immediate way to modulate synaptic strength cycle by cycle in rhythmically active networks.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",12598609,,,MP,HH,1,"No EEG, Heart interneurons",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Koizumi, Nishino, Brooks",,1977,Centers involved in the autonomic reflex reactions originating from stretching of the atria.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Stretching the atria in anesthetized dogs produces reflex changes in heart rate  and in cardiac and renal sympathetic nerve activity. Anemic decerebration  cord transection at C4-C5  and severance of vagal or sympathetic cardiac nerves was done to identify the pathways and centers essential for these reflexes. Stretching the right atrium produced an aceleration of the heart and a definite increase in sympathetic nerve activity. Left atrial-stretch caused biphasic responses: an initial sympathetic nerve inhibition and slower heartbeat folowed by sympathetic excitation and heart acceleration. The afferents responsible were carried mainly by the vagi; efferent neural control of the heart was mostly sympathetic. The reflex inhibition observed was integrated chiefly at the medullary level  but supramedullary structures contributed to the augmentation in sympathetic activity and heart rate. When central connections between vagal afferent and sympathetic efferent pathways were separated by cord transection  atrial stretch caused a decrease in heart rate due to reflex action through the vagal loop. After the cord was sectioned  we found that some afferent impulses from the atria traveling in sympathetic nerves produced a slight reflex augmentation of sympathetic efferent activity  though insufficient to affect the heart rate. Somatosympathetic reflexes evoked in cardiac and renal sympathetic nerves by stimulation of various somatic afferent pathways were also affected by atrial stretch indicating central nervous system interactions.

"Lavine, Haglund, Hochman",,2012,Dynamic linear model analysis of optical imaging data acquired from the human neocortex.,Journal of neuroscience methods,The amount of light absorbed and scattered by neocortical tissue is altered by neuronal activity. Imaging of intrinsic optical signals (ImIOS)  a technique for mapping these activity-evoked optical changes with an imaging detector  has the potential to be useful for both clinical and experimental investigations of the human neocortex. However  its usefulness for human studies is currently limited because intraoperatively acquired ImIOS data is noisy. To improve the reliability and usefulness of ImIOS for human studies  it is desirable to find appropriate methods for the removal of noise artifacts and its statistical analysis. Here we develop a Bayesian  dynamic linear modeling approach that appears to address these problems. A dynamic linear model (DLM) was constructed that included cyclic components to model the heartbeat and respiration artifacts  and a local linear component to model the activity-evoked response. The robustness of the model was tested on a set of ImIOS data acquired from the exposed cortices of six human subjects illuminated with either 535nm or 660nm light. The DLM adequately reduced noise artifacts in these data while reliably preserving their activity-evoked optical responses. To demonstrate how these methods might be used for intraoperative neurosurgical mapping  optical data acquired from a single human subject during direct electrical stimulation of the cortex were quantitatively analyzed. This example showed that the DLM can be used to provide quantitative information about human ImIOS data that is not available through qualitative analysis alone.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",21640137,,,MP,HH,1,not relevant,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far  heartbeat noise has been minimized by subtracting from each experimental trial an average of interlaced control recordings. This method  however  is time-consuming and increases tissue damage due to phototoxicity. Here we applied independent component analysis (ICA) to in vivo optical recordings  for separation of auditory signals and noises.

"Mahadevan, Lappé, Rhyne, Cruz-Bermúdez, Marder, Goy",,2004,Nitric oxide inhibits the rate and strength of cardiac contractions in the lobster Homarus americanus by acting on the cardiac ganglion.,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,The lobster heart is synaptically driven by the cardiac ganglion  a spontaneously bursting neural network residing within the cardiac lumen. Here  we present evidence that nitric oxide (NO) plays an inhibitory role in lobster cardiac physiology. (1) NO decreases heartbeat frequency and amplitude. Decreased frequency is a direct consequence of a decreased ganglionic burst rate. Decreased amplitude is an indirect consequence of decreased burst frequency  attributable to the highly facilitating nature of the synapses between cardiac ganglion neurons and muscle fibers (although  during prolonged exposure to NO  amplitude recovers to the original level by a frequency-independent adaptation mechanism). NO does not alter burst duration  spikes per burst  heart muscle contractility  or amplitudes of synaptic potentials evoked by stimulating postganglionic motor nerves. Thus  NO acts on the ganglion  but not on heart muscle. (2) Two observations suggest that NO is produced within the lobster heart. First  immunoblot analysis shows that nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is strongly expressed in heart muscle relative to other muscles. Second  L-nitroarginine (L-NA)  an NOS inhibitor  increases the rate of the heartbeat (opposite to the effects of NO). In contrast  the isolated ganglion is insensitive to L-NA  suggesting that heart muscle (but not the ganglion) produces endogenous NO. Basal heart rate varies from animal to animal  and L-NA has the greatest effect on the slowest hearts  presumably because these hearts are producing the most NO. Thus  because the musculature is a site of NOS expression  whereas the ganglion is the only intracardiac target of NO  we hypothesize that NO serves as an inhibitory retrograde transmitter.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",15028775,,,MP,JM,1,not relevant,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nicholls, Wallace",,1978,Quantal analysis of transmitter release at an inhibitory synapse in the central nervous system of the leech.,The Journal of physiology,The quantal nature of transmitter release has been analysed at central inhibitory synapses in the leech nervous system between an interneurone (HN) and a motoneurone (HE) that regulate the heartbeat. 1. Ganglia were bathed in leech Ringer fluid containing 20 mM-Mg and 1.8 mM-Ca and the membrane of the presynaptic HN interneurone was hyperpolarized by current injection. Under these conditions successive inhibitory potentials in the HE motoneurone  evoked by impulses in the HN interneurone  showed striking fluctuations in amplitude. 2. Assuming a Poisson distribution of the i.p.s.p.s and estimating the number of failures from the amplitude histograms of the observed responses  the mean size of the quantal unit was estimated as 0.25 +/- 0.015 mV (S.E. of mean  n = 26). When m  the mean number of quanta released per trial  was varied by changing the membrane potential of the presynaptic HN cell (Nicholls &amp; Wallace  1978)  the experimentally observed amplitude distributions could be predicted by the Poisson theory. 3. An independent estimate of the unit size was obtained by noise analysis. A long subthreshold depolarizing pulse applied to the presynaptic HN interneurone evoked a sustained hyperpolarization of the HE motoneurone  apparently caused by an increase in the rate of on-going release of quanta by the HN cell terminals. From the mean change in membrane potential and the increase in variance  the size of the unit was calculated as 0.21 +/- 0.039 mV (S.E. of mean  n = 11). For ten pairs of cells an estimate of unit amplitude was made both from the Poisson analysis and the analysis of variance  again with good agreement. For these cells the estimated unit sizes were 0.24 +/- 0.023 mV (S.E. of mean  n = 10) from the failures and 0.21 +/- 0.043 m V (S.E. of mean  n = 10) from the noise. 4. A similar analysis was made of the inhibitory synaptic potentials evoked in one HN interneurone by stimulation of its contralateral homologue. Transmission again appeared to be qualtal; the mean unit amplitude from Poisson analysis was 0.31 +/- 0.022 mV (S.E. of mean  n = 19) and from the noise 0.29 +/- 0.027 mV (S.E. of mean  n = 3). 5. We conclude that transmitter is released from the terminals of the HN interneurone in quantal units that evoke miniature i.p.s.p.s of about 0.25 mV in the post-synaptic cells. Furthermore  modulation of transmission proudced by variation in the presynaptic resting potential and during presynaptic inhibition results from changes in the mean number of quanta released by each impulse.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",212551,,,MP,JM,1,not relevant,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nicholls, Wallace",,1978,Modulation of transmission at an inhibitory synapse in the central nervous system of the leech.,The Journal of physiology,The synaptic interactions among a group of cells in the leech C.N.S. that regulate the animal's heartbeat exhibit several remarkable features (Thompson &amp; Stent  1976 a  b  c). We have examined in detail the properties of the inhibitory synapse between two of these cells  the heart interneurone (HN cell) and the heart excitor motoneurone (HE cell). 1. Impulses in the presynaptic HN cell gave rise to monosynaptic i.p.s.p.s in the HE cell that were blocked by high concentrations of Mg and were reversed when the membrane potential of the post-synaptic motoneurone was hyperpolarized beyond--75 m V or when Cl was injected into the cell body. These i.p.s.p.s were chemically mediated  and involved an increase in chloride conductance. 2. In contrast to chemical synapses between sensory and motor cells in the leech C.N.S.  little facilitation or depression of transmission occurred when the HN cell was stimulated at frequencies of 0.1--50 Hz. 3. Steady subthreshold depolarization of the presynaptic HN interneurone evoked a maintained hyperpolarization of the post-synaptic HE cell  indicating that currents injected into the HN cell body could spread to the terminals and cause continuous release of transmitter. 4. The size of the i.p.s.p. evoked in the HE motoneurone by an action potential in the HN interneurone varied with the resting membrane potential of the presynaptic cell. An impulse superimposed on a prolonged  subthreshold  depolarizing pulse produced a larger i.p.s.p.; conversely  prolonged hyperpolarization of the HN interneurone reduced the i.p.s.p. amplitude recorded in the HE cell. This effect was most obvious when the natural  rhythmical bursts of activity in the HN interneurone were interrupted by bathing the preparation in leech Ringer fluid containing elevated concentrations of Mg. Under these conditions a 10 mV depolarization of the HN cell increased the size of the i.p.s.p. in the HE cell approximately sixfold. Significant changes in i.p.s.p. amplitude occurred without any noticeable change in the amplitude and duration of the presynaptic action potential. With large presynaptic depolarizations  which produced the biggest i.p.s.p.s  there was some reduction in the amplitude and increase in the duration of the action potential. 5. Following a step depolarization of the presynaptic cell  the size of successive i.p.s.p.s increased with a time constant of about 1 sec. Upon repolarization the i.p.s.p.s decreased in amplitude to the original level. 6. stimulation of one HN cell also gives rise to an i.p.s.p. in its contralateral homologue (Thompson &amp; Stent  1976c). Trains of i.p.s.p.s produced in this way hyperpolarized at HN cell to such an extent that the size of the synaptic potential it evoked in an HE cell was reduced. 7. Thus  an HN interneurone inhibitis transmission between the contralateral HN and HE cells presynapitcally in addition to inhibiting directly the ipsilateral HE motoneurone.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",212550,,,MP,JM,1,not relevant,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Olypher, Cymbalyuk, Calabrese",,2007,Hybrid systems analysis of the control of burst duration by low-voltage-activated calcium current in leech heart interneurons.,Journal of neurophysiology,The leech heartbeat CPG is paced by the alternating bursting of pairs of mutually inhibitory heart interneurons that form elemental half-center oscillators. We explore the control of burst duration in heart interneurons using a hybrid system  where a living  pharmacologically isolated  heart interneuron is connected with artificial synapses to a model heart interneuron running in real-time  by focusing on a low-voltage-activated (LVA) calcium current I(CaS). The transition from silence to bursting in this half-center oscillator occurs when the spike frequency of the bursting interneuron declines to a critical level  f(Final)  at which the inhibited interneuron escapes owing to a build-up of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current  I(h). We varied I(CaS) inactivation time constant either in the living heart interneuron or in the model heart interneuron. In both cases  varying I(CaS) inactivation time constant did not affect f(Final) of either interneuron  but in the varied interneuron  the time constant of decline of spike frequency during bursts to f(Final) and thus the burst duration varied directly and nearly linearly with I(CaS) inactivation time constant. Bursts of the opposite  nonvaried interneuron did not change. We show also that control of burst duration by I(CaS) inactivation does not require synaptic interaction by reconstituting autonomous bursting in synaptically isolated living interneurons with injected I(CaS). Therefore inactivation of LVA calcium current is critically important for setting burst duration and thus period in a heart interneuron half-center oscillator and is potentially a general intrinsic mechanism for regulating burst duration in neurons.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",16943313,,,MP,JM,1,not relevant,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2 experiments  using intracranial electroencephalography (EEG)  we investigated (1) the neural sources of HEPs  (2) the underlying mechanisms for HEP generation  and (3) the functional role of HEPs in bodily self-consciousness. In Experiment-1  we found that shortly after the heartbeat onset  phase distributions across single trials were significantly concentrated in 10% of the recording sites  mainly in the insula and the operculum  but also in other regions including the amygdala and fronto-temporal cortex. Such phase concentration was not accompanied by increased spectral power  and did not correlate with spectral power changes  suggesting that a phase resetting  rather than an additive &quot;evoked potential&quot; mechanism  underlies HEP generation. In Experiment-2  we further aimed to anatomically refine previous scalp EEG data that linked HEPs with bodily self-consciousness. We found that HEP modulations in the insula reflected an experimentally induced altered sense of self-identification.

"Pérez, Guijarro, Barcia",,2006,Suppression of the cardiac electric field artifact from the heart action evoked potential.,Medical &amp; biological engineering &amp; computing,The study of heart action-related brain potentials is strongly disrupted by the presence of an inherent cardiac electric artifact. The hypothesis is presented that most of the electric current coupled to the cardiac field surrounds the skull and flows through the scalp tissue without crossing the cranial cavity. This pseudo two-dimensional conduction model contrasts with the volumetric conduction of the brain electrical activity  and this property is exploited to cancel the cardiac electric artifact. QRS loop vector-cardiographic projections on saggital planes were recorded in 11 healthy subjects in the head and neck areas. Comparative analysis of the projection eccentricities  estimated by the correlation coefficients of the paired data on each area  supported the hypothesis and allowed the handling of the cardiac electric field at the scalp as if enclosed in a two-dimensional wrapped space. This approach permitted the combination of different heart action-related brain potentials recorded at different electrode positions to cancel the cardiac electric artifact. The cancellation method  applied to the subjects' EEG data  yielded a slow cortical potential with a negligible cardiac electric residue and an amplitude of about 1.5-2 microV  with a maximum around 150 ms and a minimum at 400 ms post-R wave.,"(""heart""[MeSH Terms] OR ""heart""[All Fields]) AND action-related[All Fields] AND (""electroencephalography""[MeSH Terms] OR ""electroencephalography""[All Fields] OR ""eeg""[All Fields]) AND potential[All Fields]",16411629,,,MP,JM,1,Methods paper not relevant ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Peterson, Calabrese",,1982,Dynamic analysis of a rhythmic neural circuit in the leech Hirudo medicinalis.,Journal of neurophysiology,1. The results of perturbation experiments demonstrate the functional diversity of the interneurons (HN cells) that generate heartbeat in the medicinal leech. 2. HN cells were individually stimulated by single current pulses. The induced activity of HN cells in the first four ganglia (cell pairs HN(1)-HN(4)) reset the rhythm of the interneuron network; induced activity of those in the fifth through seventh ganglia (cell pairs HN(5)-HN(7)) did not. 3. Cells HN(1)-HN(4) can entrain every other interneuron of the network; cells HN(5)-HN(7) cannot. 4. Thus the HN interneuron network includes two distinct subsets: cells HN(1)-HN(4) form the network's timing oscillator; cells HN(5)-HN(7)  driven by the timing oscillator  force one of the two coordination states on the heart motor neurons. 5. In general the dynamic behavior of the heart interneuron network was predictable given the web of identified synapses between HN cells. Nevertheless  the unexpected capacity of cells HN(3) and HN(4) to entrain the network shows that there are functional connections still to be found. Burst termination experiments suggest that cells HN(3) and HN(4) inhibit directly the more rostral HN cells. 6. The timing oscillation seems to arise from a balance between the endogenous polarization rhythms of interneurons HN(1)-HN(4) and selective reciprocal inhibition between these same cells.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",7062099,,,MP,JM,1,not relevant,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physiologic effects such as heartbeat  respiration  spinal cord movement  and history of stimulation can cause both the perceived intensity and recruitment of stimulation to increase or decrease  with clinical consequences. A new SCS system controls stimulation dose by measuring the recruitment of fibers in the dorsal column and by using the amplitude of the evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) to maintain stimulation within an individualized therapeutic range. Safety and efficacy of this closed-loop system was evaluated through six-month postimplantation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chronic pain subjects with back and/or leg pain who were successfully trialed received a permanent system (Evoke; Saluda Medical  Sydney  Australia). Ratings of pain (100-mm visual analogue scale [VAS] and Brief Pain Instrument [BPI])  quality of life (EuroQol instrument [EQ-5D-5L])  function (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI])  and sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) were collected at baseline and repeated three and six months after implantation.RESULTS: Fifty-one subjects underwent a trial procedure; permanent implants were placed in 36 subjects. The proportion of subjects with ≥50% relief was 92.6% (back) and 91.3% (leg) at three months  and 85.7% (back) and 82.6% (leg) at six months. The proportion with ≥80% pain relief was 70.4% (back) and 56.5% (leg) at three months  and 64.3% (back) and 60.9% (leg) at six months. Statistically significant improvements in mean BPI  EQ-5D-5L  ODI  and PSQI were also observed at both time points.CONCLUSIONS: The majority of subjects experienced profound pain relief at three and six months  providing preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of the closed-loop SCS system. The exact mechanism of action for these outcomes is still being explored  although one likely hypothesis holds that ECAP feedback control may minimize recruitment of Aβ nociceptors and Aδ fibers during daily use of SCS.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",28922517,,,JM,JM,1,Not HEP ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that focal activation of AI triggers autonomously propagating activity that resembles tone-evoked activity (Song et al.  2006). Because a focal spontaneous activity is expected to trigger similar activity propagation  spontaneous activity resembling tone-evoked activity may exist in AI. Here we tested this possibility by optical imaging of AI in guinea pigs. After obtaining tone-evoked activities  we made long-duration optical recordings (9-40s) and isolated spontaneous activities from respiration and heartbeat noises using independent component analyses. Spontaneous activities were found all over AI  in all animals examined. Of all spontaneous events  33.6% showed significant correlation in spatio-temporal pattern with tone-evoked activities. Simulation using a model that captures the temporal feature of spontaneous response in single channels but sets no constraint among channels  generated no spontaneous events that resembled tone-evoked activations. These results show the existence of spontaneous events similar in spatio-temporal pattern to tone-evoked activations in AI. Such spontaneous events are likely a manifestation of cortical structures that govern the pattern of distributed activation in AI.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",20600374,,,JM,HH,1,Non human,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sakurai, Wilkens",,2003,Tension sensitivity of the heart pacemaker neurons in the isopod crustacean Ligia pallasii.,The Journal of experimental biology,In the crustacean neurogenic heart  the cardiac ganglion (CG) acts as a peripherally located central pattern generator (CPG) by producing rhythmic motor output that initiates the heartbeat. In the isopod Ligia  the CG consists of six electrically coupled neurons that all function both as endogenous oscillators and as glutamatergic motoneurons innervating heart muscle. In the present study  we present several lines of evidence to suggest that the CG neurons are sensitive to passive stretch and active tension of the heart muscle. Stretching the heart wall caused a sustained decrease in the burst frequency of the CG neuron. Releasing from the stretch caused a rebound increase in burst frequency above the control rate. A brief stretch (200-300 ms duration) caused either phase advance or phase delay of the following CG bursts  depending on the timing at which the stretch was applied. Repeated brief stretches could entrain the CG bursts to either higher or lower frequencies than the free-run burst frequency. Intracellular recording from one of the CG neurons revealed that it exhibited hyperpolarization during the stretch. The stretch-induced hyperpolarization was followed by a burst discharge upon release from the stretch. With increased stretch amplitude  the amplitude of hyperpolarizing response increased and the timing of the following burst was advanced. When the myogenic activity of the heart muscle was pharmacologically isolated from the ganglionic drive by applying a glutamatergic antagonist  Joro spider toxin (JSTX)  the spontaneous muscle contraction caused a hyperpolarizing deflection in the CG neuron. Under specific conditions made by JSTX and tetrodotoxin  the CG burst became entrained to the myogenic rhythm. These results suggest that the Ligia CG neurons have tension sensitivity in addition to their pacemaker and motoneuronal functions. Such multifunctional neurons may form a single neuron reflex arc inside the heart.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",12456701,,,JM,HH,1,Non human,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sakurai, Yamagishi",,2000,Graded neuromuscular transmission in the heart of the isopod crustacean Ligia exotica.,The Journal of experimental biology,We present several lines of evidence for the occurrence of graded synaptic transmission in addition to impulse-mediated transmission at the neuromuscular junction between cardiac ganglion (CG) neurones and the myocardium in the isopod crustacean Ligia exotica. In the heart of adult Ligia exotica  the CG acts as a primary pacemaker for the heartbeat by generating periodic bursts of impulses and entrains the myogenicity of the myocardium via impulse-mediated excitatory junctional potentials. When impulse generation was blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX; 50 nmol l(-)(1))  the CG neurones and the myocardium periodically exhibited synchronized slow depolarizing potentials. The association between the slow depolarizing potentials in the neurone and the myocardium was eliminated by application of Joro spider toxin (JSTX)  a specific glutamate antagonist. When the CG neurone was made quiescent by a higher dose of TTX (1.0 micromol l(-)(1))  sinusoidal current injected into the CG neurone induced similar sinusoidal membrane potential responses in the myocardium. The sinusoidal muscle responses were eliminated by application of either JSTX or low-Ca(2+) saline. Under voltage-clamp conditions  the myocardium exhibited periodic inward current responses to sinusoidal current stimuli applied to the CG neurone. The reversal potential for the current response of the myocardium was similar to that of the impulse-mediated excitatory junctional current (EJC). Extracellular macropatch recordings of EJCs made at the neuromuscular junctional site revealed the spontaneous appearance of miniature EJCs asynchronous with the CG spikes in addition to large spike-evoked EJCs. The miniature EJCs were present in saline containing TTX  and their frequency was strongly affected by the slow membrane potential change in the CG neurone. These results suggest that the CG neurones drive the myocardium by graded neuromuscular transmission in addition to impulse-mediated transmission in the heart of Ligia exotica.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",10751160,,,JM,HH,1,Non human,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Salt, Hullar",,2010,"Responses of the ear to low frequency sounds, infrasound and wind turbines.",Hearing research,Infrasonic sounds are generated internally in the body (by respiration  heartbeat  coughing  etc) and by external sources  such as air conditioning systems  inside vehicles  some industrial processes and  now becoming increasingly prevalent  wind turbines. It is widely assumed that infrasound presented at an amplitude below what is audible has no influence on the ear. In this review  we consider possible ways that low frequency sounds  at levels that may or may not be heard  could influence the function of the ear. The inner ear has elaborate mechanisms to attenuate low frequency sound components before they are transmitted to the brain. The auditory portion of the ear  the cochlea  has two types of sensory cells  inner hair cells (IHC) and outer hair cells (OHC)  of which the IHC are coupled to the afferent fibers that transmit &quot;hearing&quot; to the brain. The sensory stereocilia (&quot;hairs&quot;) on the IHC are &quot;fluid coupled&quot; to mechanical stimuli  so their responses depend on stimulus velocity and their sensitivity decreases as sound frequency is lowered. In contrast  the OHC are directly coupled to mechanical stimuli  so their input remains greater than for IHC at low frequencies. At very low frequencies the OHC are stimulated by sounds at levels below those that are heard. Although the hair cells in other sensory structures such as the saccule may be tuned to infrasonic frequencies  auditory stimulus coupling to these structures is inefficient so that they are unlikely to be influenced by airborne infrasound. Structures that are involved in endolymph volume regulation are also known to be influenced by infrasound  but their sensitivity is also thought to be low. There are  however  abnormal states in which the ear becomes hypersensitive to infrasound. In most cases  the inner ear's responses to infrasound can be considered normal  but they could be associated with unfamiliar sensations or subtle changes in physiology. This raises the possibility that exposure to the infrasound component of wind turbine noise could influence the physiology of the ear.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",20561575,,,JM,HH,1,Not HEP ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the current investigation was to clarify whether the impaired CNS representation of visceral-afferent neural signals in DPD is restricted to the cortical level or is also present in sub-cortical structures. We used cardiac modulation of startle (CMS) to assess baro-afferent signal transmission at brainstem level in 22 DPD and 23 healthy control individuals. The CMS paradigm involved acoustic startle stimuli (105dB(A)  50ms) elicited 0  100  200  300  400 and 500ms after a cardiac R-wave. In healthy control individuals  we observed lower startle responses at 100 and 300ms than at 0 and 400ms after an R-wave. In DPD patients  no effect of the cardiac cycle on startle response magnitude was found. We conclude that the representation of visceral-afferent neural signals at brainstem level may be deficient in DPD. This effect may be due to increased peripheral sympathetic tone or to dysregulated signal processing at brainstem level. ,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",27078753,,,JM,HH,1,Not HEP ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Simon, Opdyke, Calabrese",,1992,Modulatory effects of FMRF-NH2 on outward currents and oscillatory activity in heart interneurons of the medicinal leech.,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,Using single-electrode voltage clamp  heart interneurons of the medicinal leech were shown to possess both a rapidly inactivating outward current  IA  and a more slowly inactivating outward current  IK. IA and IK could be separated by their voltage sensitivity and kinetic properties. FMRF-NH2 (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2) modulates IK by shifting both steady state activation and inactivation to more hyperpolarized potentials  but it does not affect the time constants. IA and IK appear to use K+ as a charge carrier; a change in the external [K+] produced a shift in the apparent reversal potential in the direction predicted with potassium as the charge carrier. Both IA and IK are sensitive to tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)  and TEA and 4-AP both interfere with the effects of FMRF-NH2 on IK. The biophysical properties of IA and of IK in the presence and absence of FMRF-NH2 were incorporated into a Hodgkin-Huxley model of these currents that could reproduce voltage-clamp data. FMRF-NH2 produces two apparently dissimilar effects on the heartbeat rhythm--acceleration and disruption. We suggest that both effects could result from the hyperpolarizing shifts in steady state activation and inactivation of IK.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",1346805,,,JM,HH,1,Non human,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stewart, Huang, Arnett, Celikel",,2014,Spontaneous oscillations in intrinsic signals reveal the structure of cerebral vasculature.,Journal of neurophysiology,Functional imaging of intrinsic signals allows minimally invasive spatiotemporal mapping of stimulus representations in the cortex  but representations are often corrupted by stimulus-independent spatial artifacts  especially those originating from the blood vessels. In this paper  we present novel algorithms for unsupervised identification of cerebral vascularization  allowing blind separation of stimulus representations from noise. These algorithms commonly take advantage of the temporal fluctuations in global reflectance to extract anatomic information. More specifically  the phase of low-frequency oscillations relative to global fluctuations reveals local vascular identity. Arterioles can be reconstructed using their characteristically high power in those frequencies corresponding to respiration  heartbeat  and vasomotion signals. By treating the vasculature as a dynamic flow network  we finally demonstrate that direction of blood perfusion can be quantitatively visualized. Application of these methods for removal of stimulus-independent changes in reflectance permits isolation of stimulus-evoked representations even if the representation spatially overlaps with blood vessels. The algorithms can be expanded further to extract temporal information on blood flow  monitor revascularization following a focal stroke  and distinguish arterioles from venules and parenchyma.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",23554431,,,JM,HH,1,Methods paper not relevant ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sueyoshi, Sugimoto, Katayama, Fukushima",,2015,Neural correlates of error processing reflect individual differences in interoceptive sensitivity.,International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology,Although self-monitoring is an important process for adaptive behaviors in multiple domains  the exact relationship among different internal monitoring systems is unclear. Here  we aimed to determine whether and how physiological monitoring (interoception) and behavioral monitoring (error processing) are related to each other. To this end we examined within-subject correlations among measures representing each function. Score on the heartbeat counting task (HCT) was used as a measure of interoceptive awareness. The amplitude of two event-related potentials (error-related negativity [ERN] and error-positivity [Pe]) elicited in error trials of a choice-reaction task (Simon task) were used as measures of error processing. The Simon task presented three types of stimuli (objects  faces showing disgust  and happy faces) to further examine how emotional context might affect inter-domain associations. Results showed that HCT score was robustly correlated with Pe amplitude (the later portion of error-related neural activity)  irrespective of stimulus condition. In contrast  HCT score was correlated with ERN amplitude (the early component) only when participants were presented with disgust-faces as stimuli  which may have automatically elicited a physiological response. Behavioral data showed that HCT score was associated with the degree to which reaction times slowed after committing errors in the object condition. Cardiac activity measures indicated that vigilance level would not explain these correlations. These results suggest a relationship between physiological and behavioral monitoring. Furthermore  the degree to which behavioral monitoring relies on physiological monitoring appears to be flexible and depend on the situation. ,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",25307770,,,JM,HH,1,Not HEP ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"van Buuren, Gladwin, Zandbelt, van den Heuvel, Ramsey, Kahn, Vink",,2009,Cardiorespiratory effects on default-mode network activity as measured with fMRI.,Human brain mapping,The default-mode network (DMN) consists of areas showing more activation during rest than during a task. Several authors propose some form of cognitive processing to underlie BOLD signal changes in the DMN as activity within the network is modulated by the level of effort required by the task and is positively correlated with self-referential processing. Alternatively  BOLD signal changes within the DMN may be caused by cardiorespiratory processes (CR) affecting BOLD signal measurements independent of neuronal activity. The goal of this study is to investigate whether BOLD signal changes within the DMN can be explained by CR effects. To this aim  brain activity  heartbeat  and respiration are measured during resting-state and while subjects perform a cognitive task with a high- and low-demand condition. To correct for CR effects we used RETROICOR (Glover et al.  [2000]: Magn Reson Med 44:162-167) in combination with additive linear modeling of changes due to respiration volume  heart rate and heart rate variability. CR effects were present within the frequency-range of the DMN and were located in areas of the DMN  but equally so in other areas. After removal of CR effects  deactivation and resting-state connectivity between the areas of the DMN remained significant. In addition  DMN deactivation was still modulated by task demand. The same CR correction method did remove activation in task-related areas. We take these results to indicate that the BOLD signal within the DMN cannot be explained by CR effects alone and is possibly related to some form of cognitive neuronal processing.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",19180557,,,JM,HH,1,Not EEG,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"van Elk, Lenggenhager, Heydrich, Blanke",,2014,Suppression of the auditory N1-component for heartbeat-related sounds reflects interoceptive predictive coding.,Biological psychology,Although many studies have elucidated the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting the processing of externally generated sensory signals  less is known about the processing of interoceptive signals related to the viscera. Drawing a parallel with research on agency and the perception of self-generated action effects  in the present EEG study we report a reduced auditory N1 component when participants listened to heartbeat-related sounds compared to externally generated sounds. The auditory suppression for heartbeat sounds was robust and persisted after controlling for ECG-related artifacts  the number of trials involved and the phase of the cardiac cycle. In addition  the auditory N1 suppression for heartbeat-related sounds had a comparable scalp distribution as the N1 suppression observed for actively generated sounds. This finding indicates that the brain automatically differentiates between heartbeat-related and externally generated sounds through a process of sensory suppression  suggesting that a comparable predictive mechanism may underlie the processing of heartbeat and action-related information. Extending recent behavioral data about cardio-visual integration  the present cardio-auditory EEG data reveal that the processing of sounds in auditory cortex is systematically modulated by an interoceptive cardiac signal. The findings are discussed with respect to theories of interoceptive awareness  emotion  predictive coding  and their relevance to bodily self-consciousness. ,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",24680787,,,JM,HH,1,Not HEP ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Viola, Thorne, Edmonds, Schneider, Eichele, Debener",,2009,Semi-automatic identification of independent components representing EEG artifact.,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,OBJECTIVE: Independent component analysis (ICA) can disentangle multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into a number of artifacts and brain-related signals. However  the identification and interpretation of independent components is time-consuming and involves subjective decision making. We developed and evaluated a semi-automatic tool designed for clustering independent components from different subjects and/or EEG recordings.METHODS: CORRMAP is an open-source EEGLAB plug-in  based on the correlation of ICA inverse weights  and finds independent components that are similar to a user-defined template. Component similarity is measured using a correlation procedure that selects components that pass a threshold. The threshold can be either user-defined or determined automatically. CORRMAP clustering performance was evaluated by comparing it with the performance of 11 users from different laboratories familiar with ICA.RESULTS: For eye-related artifacts  a very high degree of overlap between users (phi&gt;0.80)  and between users and CORRMAP (phi&gt;0.80) was observed. Lower degrees of association were found for heartbeat artifact components  between users (phi&lt;0.70)  and between users and CORRMAP (phi&lt;0.65).CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that CORRMAP provides an efficient  convenient and objective way of clustering independent components.SIGNIFICANCE: CORRMAP helps to efficiently use ICA for the removal EEG artifacts.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",19345611,,,JM,HH,1,Methods paper not relevant ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yamagishi, Hirose",,1997,Transfer of the heart pacemaker during juvenile development in the isopod crustacean Ligia exotica.,The Journal of experimental biology,Developmental changes in heartbeat pacemaker mechanisms were examined electrophysiologically in the isopod crustacean Ligia exotica. The heartbeat of embryos and early juveniles was myogenic. The heart muscle cells were coupled electrically  and no localized pacemaker activity was found in the heart. In newly hatched juveniles  the cardiac ganglion exhibited no spontaneous activity  although stimulation of the cardiac ganglion produced excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) in the heart muscle. The myogenic activity of the heart was reset and entrained by the EJPs evoked by ganglionic stimulation. During juvenile development  spontaneous EJPs appeared irregularly in the heart muscle. Later in development  the cardiac ganglion started rhythmic bursting  and each muscle response followed a ganglionic burst discharge and overlapped the EJPs evoked by ganglionic activity. At this point  the activity of the cardiac ganglion was suppressed by application of tetrodotoxin (TTX); however  even in old adults  both muscle activity and the heartbeat continued following TTX application. Heartbeat frequency was lower in TTX-containing saline than in normal saline. These results show that  during juvenile development  the heart pacemaker is transferred from the heart muscle to the cardiac ganglion  which becomes the primary pacemaker and entrains the heart muscle activity to a higher frequency via EJPs.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",9343853,,,JM,HH,1,Non human,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yamagishi, Miyamoto, Sakurai",,2005,Developmental changes in dopamine modulation of the heart in the isopod crustacean Ligia exotica: reversal of chronotropic effect.,Zoological science,Developmental changes in dopamine modulation of the heart were examined in the isopod crustacean Ligia exotica. The Ligia cardiac pacemaker is transferred from the myocardium to the cardiac ganglion during juvenile development and the heartbeat changes from myogenic to neurogenic. In the myogenic heart of early juveniles  dopamine affected the myocardium and caused a decrease in the frequency and an increase in the duration of the myocardial action potential  resulting in negative chronotropic (decrease in beat frequency) and positive inotropic (increase in contractile force) effects on the heart. Contrastingly  in the heart of immature adults just after juvenile development  dopamine caused effects of adult type  positive chronotropic and positive inotropic effects on the heart affecting the cardiac ganglion and myocardium. During the middle and late juvenile stages  dopamine caused individually a negative or a positive chronotropic effect on the heart. These results suggest that the chronotropic effect of dopamine on the Ligia heart is reversed from negative to positive in association with the cardiac pacemaker transfer from the myocardium to the cardiac ganglion during juvenile development.,"(""Heartbeat""[Journal] OR ""heartbeat""[All Fields]) AND (""evoked potentials""[MeSH Terms] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potentials""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potentials""[All Fields] OR (""evoked""[All Fields] AND ""potential""[All Fields]) OR ""evoked potential""[All Fields])",15459449,,,JM,HH,1,Non human,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part A, Molecular &amp; integrative physiology",The regulation of the heartbeat by the two largest neurons  d-VLN and d-RPLN  on the dorsal surface of visceral and right parietal ganglia of Giant African snail  Achatina fulica  was examined. Using the new method of animal preparation  for the first time  discrete biphasic inhibitory-excitatory junction potentials (I-EJPs) in the heart and several muscles of the visceral sac were recorded. The duration of hyperpolarizing phase (H-phase) of biphasic I-EJPs was 269+/-5.6 ms (n=5)  which is 2-3 times less than that of the cholinergic inhibitory JPs (682+/-68.5 ms  n=5). The H-phase of I-EJPs was not altered by the application of atropine  picrotoxine  succinylcholinchloride  D-tubocurarine and tetraethylammonium or substitution of Cl(-) ions. Even the low-frequency neuronal discharges (1-2 imp/s) evoked significant facilitation and potentiation of the H-phase. Between the multimodal neurons d-VLN/d-RPLN and mantle or visceral organs there is evidence of direct synaptic connections. These neurons were found to have no axonal branches in the intestinal nerve as once suspected but reach the heart through several other nerves.
